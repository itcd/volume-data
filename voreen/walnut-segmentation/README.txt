This archive contains probabilistic segmentations as well as binary masks of
four segments of the Voreen walnut dataset (http://www.voreen.org/files/walnut.zip):
 * complete nut
 * outer nutshell
 * core (enclosing the seed)
 * seed
 
Additionally, the "walnut-segmentation" volume stores the complete segmentation by
assigning the intensity values 1 till 4 to the four segments.

The walnut data set is courtesy of European Institut of Molecular Imaging (EIMI),
Muenster, Germany (http://www.uni-muenster.de/EIMI/).

The segmentations have been obtained with our guided Random Walker approach:
  J.-S. Prassni, T. Ropinski, and K. Hinrichs: Uncertainty-Aware Guided Volume Segmentation.
  IEEE TVCG, 16(6): 1358-1365, 2010.

You may use the segmentations freely, but please include the above reference, 
if you use them in scientific work.
